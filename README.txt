One group member should fork this repository and add all other group members as collaborators.
Decide amongst your group who will create which lines of the story. There's a title and 6 lines to split up between group members. 
Each group member will then create their own branch, download the repo, and edit the groupstory file. Only edit your line(s) so as not to overwrite your group members work when you merge. Make up the title or line you are assigned without discussing it with your group members, so you can read the random (hopefully entertaining) story when it's all finished.
When you've completed your task(s), upload the file to the repo on your branch, then merge with the main branch.
